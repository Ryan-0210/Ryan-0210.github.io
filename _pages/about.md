        <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
        <p>My name is Haiyang Liao, a graduate student in <a href="https://es.nju.edu.cn/acei/main.htm">Geological Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://es.nju.edu.cn/mainm.htm">School of Earth Sciences and Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.nju.edu.cn/">Nanjing University</a>. Currently, I am actively preparing to apply for Ph.D. programs.</p>

        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        <p>My specialization is in applying fiber-optic distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) technologies to image urban shallow subsurfaces, utilizing both active and passive seismic sources to enhance the accuracy and depth of subsurface mapping. I am dedicated to furthering my studies and research in seismology algorithms and programming, exploring the diverse applications of DAS technology across various contexts.</p>

            <p>During my academic journey at Nanjing University under the guidance of <a href="https://es.nju.edu.cn/geosensing/">Dr. Dan Zhang</a>, I primarily focus on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Urban Ground Collapse Monitoring:</strong> Utilizing existing dark fibers or dedicated vibration sensing optical cables to detect urban ground collapses through both active and passive seismic imaging. This major research focus during my master's studies involves extensive participation in experiments and research using DAS seismology.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Geological Exploration for the Shangyuanmen Railway Yangtze River Tunnel Project in Nanjing:</strong> Employing DAS imaging and DAS VSP to investigate the distribution of karst in areas where dolomite is prevalent. As the student leader on this project, I am responsible for designing the experimental plan, coordinating with multiple parties, implementing the field tests, processing data, and co-authoring the final report.

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Urban Ground Collapse Monitoring:</strong> (May 2024 - Present) Deployed fiber optic cables near campus wells to validate cavity detection with DAS. Studied lateral detection ranges using the three-station interferometry method to address uneven noise.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Optical Fiber Cable Coupling Methods Study:</strong> (May 2024 - Present) Installed fiber optic cables on campus using different coupling methods to compare imaging effects from active and passive sources.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Karst Fracture Zone Detection in Mufu Mountain, Nanjing:</strong> (January 2024 - August 2024) Laid fiber optic cables on roads near Mufu Mountain, applying the frequency-Bessel method to detect fractured karst zones in dolomite.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Numerical Simulation for Subsurface Cavity Detection:</strong> (January 2023 - October 2023) Used specfem3d/2d for simulations of shallow cavities to analyze DAS imaging responses.
