  <h2> Research on the mechanism by which large underground structures impact land subsidence </h2>
  <p> 07/2023 - present</p>
  <p>- The Opening Project of Observation and Research Station of Ground Fissure and Land Subsidence, Ministry of Natural Resources, Xi’an, China, Project leader.
  <p>- Clarified the mechanism of pumping-induced land subsidence and explained why the subsidence lagging behind the change of groundwater level.</p>
  <p>- Established a numerical model for regional land subsidence in the field within large underground structures taking into soil-structure interaction consideration</p>

  <h2> Research on the impact mechanism and prevention measures of land subsidence on metro tunnels in loess zone </h2>
  <p> 07/2021 - 01/2023</p>
  <p>- Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41372328).
  <p>- Revealed the failure mechanism of tunnel induced by land subsidence</p>
 <p>- Proposed an analytical solution to calculate the mechanical response of a shield tunnel crossing an active ground fissure zone</p>
  <p>- Identified the deformation and mechanical characteristics of tunnel in the process of active ground fissure dislocation</p>
